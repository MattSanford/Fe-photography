				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>My name is Felicia and I am an avid photographer living in Richmond, Virginia. I have had an interest in photogrphy since Jr. high and during highschool it became more of an obssession then a hobby. I love capturing moments that families will cherish for years to come and I would love to be able to do the same for you. I specialize in Weddings, Newborn, Couples, and Senior Pictures. I place emphasis on making the shoot natural and comfortable instead of making you feel like mannequins. Most imporatntly, I make sure that I accommodate YOU. If you have an idea for a shot, I will be more than willing to try and capture the moment you have in your mind and get it in a picture frame.  </p>
